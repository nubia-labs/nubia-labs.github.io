## A Scientific and Entrepreneurial Journey

I am an entrepreneur, technologist, and lifelong learner driven by projects that move seamlessly between big-picture strategy and execution. My passion lies in leveraging technology to make a real-world impact, especially through transformational innovations with deep socio-economic implications.

Over the past 15 years, I’ve transitioned from academia to roles as a researcher, software engineer, architect, technical leader, and co-founder of international startups. My most recent success was co-founding Fyde, later acquired by Barracuda Networks, where I led engineering initiatives and co-founded the "cuda-data-labs" team. This team harnessed data science and AI to transform enterprise workflows across functions like product, finance, marketing, and customer success, revealing insights and driving impactful changes.

## Consulting in AI and ML: A New Chapter

### Building for the World

After years in startups, I launched Nubia Labs, inspired by companies like ThoughtBot and Plataformatec, known for blending customer value with community contributions like open-source projects and educational initiatives. At Nubia Labs, we aim to replicate this ethos—building value through education, learning, and open-source work.

### Navigating Transformation

We’re at a pivotal moment in the history of knowledge work. Advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), are reshaping how we work at a pace unlike any before. My career has spanned deep technological transformations — from Geocities sites to webapps with RoR and Django, to the iPhone and proliferation of mobile apps, to the rise of React.js, frontend frameworks and serverless deployments, to Scala and then Python and pandas, to the first release of ChatGPT that really made the world sit up and take notice. This era of AI promises to profoundly impact not just knowledge workers but every aspect of life and work, democratizing access to technology and empowering individuals to build and automate like never before.

### Building for the Future

AI, as Andrew Ng aptly puts it, is becoming the new electricity. But unlike previous technological shifts that primarily affected knowledge workers, AI is transforming how everyone lives and works. We are witnessing the dawn of an era where people can "talk" to computers through natural language, create their own tools, and automate workflows without limitations imposed by engineering teams. While current LLM implementations and their UX are still far from realizing their full potential, they are already revolutionizing the workflows of early adopters at a surprising pace. AI agents open the door to unprecedented automation, enabling the  delegation of tasks that once required (a lot of repetitive) human effort. And this is only the beginning of what we can uncover.

## My Mission at Nubia Labs

This transformation is both challenging and exciting. While AI’s future is still unfolding, one truth is clear: those who adapt will thrive. At Nubia Labs, my personal mission is to bridge my experience with emerging technologies to help companies and individuals navigate this shift. We are committed to sharing knowledge, fostering community growth, and shaping a future where technology amplifies human potential.
